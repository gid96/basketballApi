The type of application I am building will be a basketball league tracker. This will use express from node to build my API, it'll also utilize DataGrip for my SQL table and a GUI interface using HTML & CSS.

| **What is it?**           | This will address a problem which currently users aren't able to register their teams, players, schedule games, post scores and game outcomes.<br />This will give me the opportunity to create an API which will handle the different type of requests users will have and wish to input for their given<br /> team, a GUI to allow a simple and welcoming experience for the user & a DB to contain all of the data that the various users will input to the <br />application.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **When to use it?**       | You would use this whenever a new team wants to register to the league, if the team wanted to update their roster with additional players or<br />removal of players, also updating the final results of the matches to see who won and what the final score of the game was.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **How to use it?**        | At the moment players who want to play in the league are using an ancient method of pen and paper to track how many teams want to play in<br />the league and which players are assigned to those teams. I am going to build an application which will allow users to input their teams info:<br />from players, the numbers which the players will wear, their contact info (accessible only to the owner of the given team and admin), the role of <br />the given player (point guard, centre, captain, coach etc.). This will also be used to schedule games, the venue in which the game will take place<br />who will be refereeing the game, the outcome of the game (scores, who won and lost, fouls etc.) |
| **What does it achieve?** | This application will achieve an effective way for the end user to look at their team see which players are assigned to their roster, what roles<br />the players play, who and when the teams will be playing against, what the teams win loss ratio looks like and there standing in the league.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |


|                                                | Present situation                                                                                                         | Desired situation                                                                                                   | Opportunity from moving from the present to the desired state |

| Overview of what I'm<br />going to be building | Constructing a framework for node express<br />with APIs that will allow me to post, update, <br />get and delete games. | A working API which will easily allow me<br />to create, retrieve, update delete games.                             |                                                               |
| Defining the problem definition                | There isn't any way of tracking the<br />games that are currently being arranged.                                         | A way to track which games are arranged<br />and to see who's playing who and when<br />the games will take place. |                                                               |
| The aim of the MVP                             | Work in progress....                                                                                                      | Be able to perform basic CRUD operations.                                                                           |                                                               |
| Future feature of the post MVP                 | Work in progress....                                                                                                      | Have an intuitive GUI for easy & smooth<br />operation of the user.                                                 |                                                               |

3. For this project to work I will need to have an API that can perform CRUD operations using express node to begin with. Further on down the line the project will have a DB using SQL to store info on the given teams, the players within those teams, referees and their availability to referee games on the given days and to store the league standings for users to view how a given team is doing. At some point I'll need to create a GUI most likely using a React framework from JS with HTML & CSS. At some point it will be good to have a CI/CD pipeline running, probably using Jenkins as it's the continuous deployment tool which I have the most familiarity with.
